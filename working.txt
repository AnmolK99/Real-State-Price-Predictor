1. After loading the dataset we clean it from very Discreet impossible for real life values.
2. Before cleaning the dataset looks like image - original and predicted after Learning.jpg
3. data cleaning is not very universal so some data may look discreet.
4. Linear Regression is  used as it seems to be most effective in this dataset.
5. (in original and predicted after Learning.jpg) Finally the left graph shows all values of data of houses 
   and the right one shows one after 40% of data is predicted and is showed as red squares while cyan stars 
   shows testing data.
6. The End.
